# Redux quiz group project

This project was made during the Technigo bootcamp. We have worked in a group of five, using mob-programming. We used Redux for the first time to build a quiz about wild animals.

## The problem

We started out by scetching and planning the project to have a clear picture of what to do. For the majority of time we worked together in mob-programming so that everybody felt comfortable with Redux and how to use the global state. We learned how to interact with the global store using selectors and by dispatching actions.

We started out with a big component with most of the code in and then we moved it into smaller components for a better structure. For the styling we have use styled components. If we hade more time we would probably make the summary display the correct and wrong answers.
